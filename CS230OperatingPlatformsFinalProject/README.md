The Gaming Room is a gaming software company with an android app called Draw It or Lose It, which is similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose, or Draw. 
They wanted to develop a multi-platform web-based version of their android app. 
The game needed to be able to run on multiple platforms, with multiple players, teams, and games.
I believe that I did particularly well describing the development requirements for each platform in the table of the evaluation section of this documentation.
The UML diagram was by far the most useful portion of this design document for developing the code.
If I had to rewrite any one section of these documents, I would choose the Design Constraints. 
I would improve it by going into more detail about which platforms the game should run on, and I’d note how many players per team, and teams per game.
When I thought about how to implement the user’s needs into my software design, I considered security, and user friendliness. 
The user will ultimately determine the success or failure of the product, so it is paramount to keep their needs in mind during the design process.
When designing software, I first considered my client’s needs and constraints, then I considered their users’ needs. Next time I need to analyze and design a similar project, 
I will work the other way around, starting from what would be ideal, and working back until it fits within the client’s vision.
