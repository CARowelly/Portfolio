•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project is a tool for Driver’s Education Students to enable participation in self-study and practical on-road instruction in preparation for the State Department of Motor Vehicle’s licensing exam. 
The owner of DriverPass, a driver’s education school, wanted a system designed to provide his customers with up-to-date practice examinations based on the most current DMV instruction guidelines. 
The system will also include a scheduling service to connect student drivers with instructors and fleet vehicles for practical instruction in preparation for the DMV’s on-road test. 
The product owner wanted to give the students access to several options for subscription packages that include different levels of instruction based on price.

•	What did you do particularly well?
My strengths lie in my understanding of object-oriented programming. 
I was able to write clear and concise functional software requirements that accurately describe how the program will need to be structured.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
There is no particular section that I think I could have done better. 
As I worked on the assignments and saw other students’ solutions to problems in our discussion posts, I realized that I put too much focus on how a system will be programmed. 
In the future I will be sure to give more attention to consideration of other factors such as limiting human error and considering the user’s interaction with hardware components.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I think I was a little myopic when considering user needs. 
I was so focused on programming functionality, that I often failed to consider user interaction that occurs outside the program. 
Taking human factors and interactions in the phyisical world will receive more of my attention in the future.

•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I have been Object Model focused when designing software. 
I have a tendency to build one class at a time, with its attributes, then add methods and workflow. 
In the future I will start with a use case model to better understand the entire environment in which my software will operate, taking the entire user experience into consideration.
Then I will build a process model before building an object model. 
I believe this method will allow me to build better, more organized, and more intuitive software. 
It will also save me time by reducing the need to restructure the objects for oversights in how the user will interact with control flow.
