How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by unit testing them completely and thoroughly. I will know my unit tests are complete and thorough when I have 100% code coverage in three categories - statement coverage, branch coverage, and decision coverage.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User focused testing involves putting yourself into a user's shoes. This can be accomplished by manually testing key application features and analyzing user stories and usability studies to write system, subsystem, and unit requirements that address user feedback, feature requests, and needs as applicable.

How do I approach designing software?

I will approach designing software methodically and logically, building class, state, and interaction models as necessary for each feature. I will ensure my code is secure by building guards. I can build guards by setting all classes or class members that do not need to be public to private or protected, and by validating input and decision branching using exceptions.
