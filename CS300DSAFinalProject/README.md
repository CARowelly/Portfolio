What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem I was solving in the projects for this course was to use data structures and algorithms to implement an appilication for reading, storing, sorting, and updating data in a csv file efficiently.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I chose a binary search tree for my program because the binary search tree presorts data which means all subsequent actions performed will be more efficient once the data is loaded.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The most major roadblock I encountered in the activities and project was that I encountered an error when attempting to display all data after removing a node.
The solution to this problem was to ensure that my root node pointed to the next node so that it did not start at a memory register that doesn't exist.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
As a programmer that regularly works with large databases, this course has helped me build a better understanding of the best methods to use for collecting and storing that data.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I have developed a stronger understanding of how encapsulating functions helps maintain readable and adaptable code.
