How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To interpret user needs and implement them into a program, I will first ask for an overview of what the user wants from a product of the type I am creating, then ask a series of survey questions about features and functions I think the user is looking for based on their overview. Creating user stories helps with this by taking that user feedback and translating it into actual feature and functional action items for developers to implement.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs by taking user stories or requested features and implementing them in the best, most efficient ways I know. I have already begun to rely on test-driven development and pair programming to improve my test plans and unit tests at work, and I have a much better understanding of why my project manager conducts our stand-up meetings the way he does now that I have a more in-depth knowledge of scrum and agile.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member in software development is first and foremost, communicative. No matter how much experience a team member has, there is always more to learn in the field of computer science and even the newest team member can teach the most experienced if they are willing to communicate and collaborate.
